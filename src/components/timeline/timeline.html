					To develop a deeper understanding of the Software Engineering industry, using my connections, I had an opportunity to go to the London Snapchat, and Spotify offices, where I was lucky enough to interview the different teams working in the company, whom gave me an insight on the important qualities and tools used in the profession. I additionally had a chance to interview the developer teams in the Google office in Silicon Valley, Los Angeles.

				<h2>Queen Mary University of London - Computer Science and Management Bachelorette</h2>
				<em>August, 2020</em>
				<p>	
					I was unable to sit the exam due to COVID-19, and my 6th Form was disadvantaged due to it being a public college. They were forced to award me with lower grades than ever expected. In the end I got an A in Maths and Computer Science and a B/C in Physics. After this, I got into the course I wanted at Queen Mary University of London (2nd best university for Computer Science in London), for a Computer Science and Management Degree.
